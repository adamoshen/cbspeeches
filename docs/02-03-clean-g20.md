# Cleaning the G20 speeches

The G20 consists of twenty members: the G7 countries, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, India,
Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkiye, the United Kingdom, the
United States, and the European Union. The cleaning process of the G20 speeches is once again nearly
identical to that used for the G7 and G10 speeches. The most notable difference is the removal of
the endings and references section of speeches, where member-specific text removal functions are
applied before the general text removal function (see `R/clean_by_country.R`).

## Initialisation


``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(pins)
library(pinsqs)
library(AzureStor)

source(here::here("R", "azure_init.R"))

speeches_board <- storage_endpoint("https://cbspeeches1.dfs.core.windows.net/", token=token) %>%
  storage_container(name = "cbspeeches") %>%
  board_azure(path = "data-speeches")
```

## Filter speeches to G20 members


``` r
g20_members <- c(
  "Argentina", "Australia", "Brazil", "Canada", "China", "France", "Germany", "India", "Indonesia",
  "Italy", "Japan", "Mexico", "Russian Federation", "Saudi Arabia", "South Africa",
  "Korea, Republic of", "Turkiye", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Other_ECB"
)

speeches <- speeches_board %>%
  pin_qread("speeches-with-country") %>%
  filter(country %in% g20_members)
```

## Fix one date

There was one speech from the United States whose date should be December 2023, not December 2024,
as this corpus only goes up to January 2024.


``` r
data_update <- tribble(
  ~doc, ~date,
  "r240109a", ymd("2023-12-08")
)

speeches <- speeches %>%
  rows_update(data_update, by="doc")
```

## Fix incomplete speech

There was one speech from the ECB that did not have the complete speech text. The full speech text
was obtained from [the speech's webpage](https://www.bis.org/review/r221027c.htm), read in from
`inst/data-misc/r221027c.txt`, and replaced the original speech text.


``` r
r221027c_text <- read_file(here::here("inst", "data-misc", "r221027c.txt")) %>%
  str_replace_all("[:cntrl:]", " ") %>%
  str_squish()

data_update <- tribble(
  ~doc, ~text,
  "r221027c", r221027c_text
)

speeches <- speeches %>%
  rows_update(data_update, by="doc")
```

## Repairs and removals

### Remove introductions

As before, the first sentence of each speech is only removed if a gratitude word is detected.
Otherwise, only the brief speech description is removed.


``` r
speeches <- speeches %>%
  mutate(
    text = if_else(
      str_detect(first_sentence, pattern="(\\*\\s){3}"),
      if_else(
        str_detect(first_sentence, pattern="(?i)thank|acknowledge|honou?r|grateful|pleas|welcome|delight"),
        str_remove(text, pattern="^[^.]+\\."),
        str_remove(text, pattern="^.*(\\*\\s){3}")
      ),
      str_remove(text, pattern="^[^.]+\\.")
    ),
    text = str_squish(text)
  )
```

### Remove section headers


``` r
speeches <- speeches %>%
  mutate(text = str_remove_all(text, "(Introduction|Closing remarks|Conclusion) (?=[:upper:])"))
```

### Remove references section

The references section and any concluding remarks were removed using country-specific cleaning
functions before applying the general cleaning function (see `R/clean_by_country.R`). The members
whose speeches required a specific cleaning function include Australia, China, Indonesia, Saudi
Arabia, South Korea, and the European Union.


``` r
source(here::here("R", "clean_by_country.R"))

speeches <- speeches %>%
  mutate(text = case_match(
    country,
    "Australia" ~ clean_australia(text),
    "China" ~ clean_china(text),
    "Indonesia" ~ clean_indonesia(text),
    "Saudi Arabia" ~ clean_saudiarabia(text),
    "Korea, Republic of" ~ clean_korea(text),
    "Other_ECB" ~ clean_ecb(text),
    .default = text
  )) %>%
  mutate(text = clean_general(text))
```

### Miscellaneous removals

Mentions of "BIS central bankers' speeches" within speeches were removed.


``` r
speeches <- speeches %>%
  mutate(text = str_remove_all(text, "(?i)BIS central bankers' speeches"))
```

### Repair typos

As Sweden and Netherlands are not part of the G20, only Italy's typos required repair.


``` r
speeches <- speeches %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "Italty", "Italy"))
```

### Remove mentions of own institution and country

It is of greater interest when a central bank mentions another central bank or another country.
Therefore, all self-mentions of the bank, country, and inhabitants were removed. For example, for
Canada, words to remove would include: Bank of Canada, BoC, Canada, Canada's, and Canadian. The
removal patterns corresponding to each bank are stored in
`inst/data-misc/bank_country_regex_patterns.csv`.


``` r
bank_country_regex_patterns <- read_delim(
  here::here("inst", "data-misc", "bank_country_regex_patterns.csv"),
  delim = ",",
  escape_backslash = TRUE
) %>%
  filter(country %in% g20_members) %>%
  select(country, regex_pattern)

speeches <- speeches %>%
  left_join(bank_country_regex_patterns, by="country") %>%
  mutate(text = str_remove_all(text, regex_pattern)) %>%
  select(-regex_pattern)
```

## General cleaning

### Normalisation of COVID related terms


``` r
speeches <- speeches %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "(?i)COVID|COVID19|COVID-19|coronavirus", "COVID"))
```

### Normalisation of select ngrams into acronyms

"Central Bank Digital Currency" is a particular 4-gram of interest and can be converted to its
abbreviated form.


``` r
speeches <- speeches %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "(?i)Central Bank Digital Currency", "CBDC"))
```

### Remove non-ascii characters, emails, social media handles, and links

The only addition to this chunk of code is the last line, where links that do not begin with http,
https, or www, are removed, e.g. `google.ca`.


``` r
speeches <- speeches %>%
  mutate(
    text = str_remove_all(text, "[:^ascii:]"),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "([[:alnum:]_.\\-]+)?@[[:alnum:].\\-]+"),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "https?://\\S+"),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "www\\.\\S+"),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "[A-Za-z]+\\.[A-Za-z]+(\\.[A-Za-z]+)*")
  )
```

### Remove/replace stray and/or excessive punctuation

A few minor changes here opting for the replacement of punctuation sequences with spaces, instead of
their removal.


``` r
speeches <- speeches %>%
  mutate(
    text = str_remove_all(text, "(\\* )+"),
    text = str_replace_all(text, "\\?|!", "."),
    text = str_remove_all(text, ","),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "\""),
    text = str_replace_all(text, "'{2,}", "'"),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "\\B'(?=[:alpha:])"),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "(?<=[:alpha:])'\\B"),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "\\B'\\B"),
    text = str_replace_all(text, "\\.{3}", "."),
    text = str_replace_all(text, " \\. ", " "),
    text = str_replace_all(text, "-", " "),
    text = str_replace_all(text, "_", " "),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "\\(|\\)|\\{|\\}|\\[|\\]|\\||;|:|\\+")
  )
```

### Remove numerical quantities

References to figures, slides, and graphs were removed, in addition to dollar signs, percent signs,
and other numerical quantities.


``` r
speeches <- speeches %>%
  mutate(
    text = str_remove_all(text, "\\$"),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "%"),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "[:digit:]+([.,]+[:digit:]+)*"),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "(Figure|Slide|Graph) [:digit:]+"),
    text = str_remove_all(text, "[:digit:]")
  )
```

### Remove excessive whitespace

Excessive whitespace resulting from previous replacements was removed.


``` r
speeches <- speeches %>%
  mutate(text = str_squish(text))
```

### Remove unneeded columns


``` r
speeches <- speeches %>%
  select(-first_sentence)
```

## Save the data

Writing the data to the pin board:


``` r
speeches_board %>%
  pin_qsave(
    speeches,
    "speeches-g20-cleaned",
    title = "speeches for g20 countries, cleaned"
  )
```

Making a separate copy of the metadata as well:


``` r
speeches_metadata <- speeches %>%
  select(doc, date, institution, country)

speeches_board %>%
  pin_qsave(
    speeches_metadata,
    "speeches-g20-metadata",
    title = "metadata for g20 speeches"
  )
```
